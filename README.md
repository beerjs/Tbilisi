# BeerJS Tbilisi

Welcome to BeerJS Tbilisi! üçª

BeerJS is a community-driven initiative where developers and tech enthusiasts gather to discuss JavaScript and related technologies in a relaxed and informal setting. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just getting started, BeerJS Tbilisi is the perfect place to connect, share knowledge, and enjoy a drink with like-minded individuals.

## Our Mission

At BeerJS Tbilisi, we aim to foster a community where everyone feels welcome to share their experiences, ideas, and challenges in the world of JavaScript and beyond. Our events are designed to be casual and open, allowing for free-flowing conversations, networking, and collaboration.

## What to Expect

We are kicking off BeerJS Tbilisi with a few informal meetups in local pubs or open spaces. These gatherings are all about connecting with others in the community, sharing ideas, and enjoying some good beer. If these initial events are successful, we plan to step it up a notch with more structured events featuring advanced talks on topics like design patterns, tackling real-life challenges in complex architectures, and more. These discussions are meant to dive deeper into the intricacies of development‚Äîperfect for those who are looking for more than just the basics.

And don‚Äôt worry, while our content will be sophisticated and aimed at tackling real-world issues, everyone is welcome. We're here to build a community that grows together, no matter your current level of expertise.

## Future Plans

If our initial events gain traction, we‚Äôll be organizing larger events with talks from experts in the field. We envision sessions that go beyond the introductory level, delving into the complexities of software development, architectural challenges, and advanced programming concepts. To make this happen, we are already exploring partnerships with local co-working spaces and have some connections with breweries who are excited to be part of the journey.

But, as with all good things, we‚Äôll start small and grow from there. You never know how successful something will be until you try!
